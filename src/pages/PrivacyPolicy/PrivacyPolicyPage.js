                <p>We do not, and will not, sell any of your personal data to any third party – including your name, address, email address or credit card information. We want to earn and maintain your trust, and we believe this is absolutely essential in order do that.

                    Companies in the Pissu Kanna group, as sometimes different bits of our group are responsible for different activities (especially licensed ones)
                    Companies that do things to get your purchases to you, such as payment service providers, warehouses, order packers, and delivery companies
                    Professional service providers, such as marketing agencies, advertising partners and website hosts, who help us run our business
                    Credit reference agencies, law enforcement and fraud prevention agencies, so we can help tackle fraud
                    Companies approved by you, such as social media sites (if you choose to link your accounts to us).
                    We may provide third parties with aggregated but anonymised information and analytics about our customers and, before we do so, we will make sure that it does not identify you.</p>
